# Form Complete

Fire whenever a user successfully completes a form. 

This event is fired when form input is successfully received and process. This is in contrast to `form_error` which occurs when a submission is attempted but an error occurs and the form input is not recieved and processed.

## Javascript Code

```js
window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
dataLayer.push({ eventModel: null, userModel: null });  // Clear the previous eventModel object.
dataLayer.push({
  event: 'form_complete',
  eventModel: {
    identifier: '<identifier>',
    name: '<name>',
    type: '<type>'
  },
});
```

## Variable Definitions

|Field|Type|Required|Description|Example|Pattern|Min Length|Max Length|Minimum|Maximum|Multiple Of|
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|identifier|string|recommended|The form machine-readable name. This should be a unique value specific to this form, if one exists. If one does not exist, this can also be populated with the same value as the <name>.|contact_us, free_trial|
|name|string|required|The form human-readable name. This should be something that an analyst without a deep knowledge of the technical implementation of the site can easily identify the form with. It should be lowercase snake_case.|contact_us, free_trial|
|type|string|required|The form type. This will act as a filtering mechanism in reporting to enable analysts to view form droppoff funnels. It can also act as an internal aid in firing additional events if necessary. For instance, lead-generating forms require a `generate_lead` event to be fired alongside `form_complete`, and that could be written into the logic based upon this field.|contact, lead_generation|
